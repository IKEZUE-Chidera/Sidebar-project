Welcome to the **Sidebar project**, which features a toggle button and an attractive sidebar. Key elements include:

- **Sidebar Components**:
  - A logo at the top.
  - A close button to hide the sidebar.
  - Navigation links for user interaction.
  - Social media icons for connectivity.

The core functionality resembles that of the previous **Nav Bar project**, with similar features but a different layout.
